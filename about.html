<p>
    Hi everyone!
</p>
<p>
    I'm a software engineer/python developer/team lead with more than 10 years of experience, having worked in both big tech companies and startups. I also have experience in leading development teams and designing and implementing backends, either independently or as part of a team.
My expertise encompasses a wide range of technologies, including various databases (SQL/NoSQL), messaging brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis PUB/SUB), different types of APIs including WebSockets, CI/CD tools (Jenkins, Gitlab CI), AWS, monitoring and tracing tools, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In this blog of mine, I'll try to give some insights on practical backend development. So, no to helloworld -ish examples, only hardcore :)
